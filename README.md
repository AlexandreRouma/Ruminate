# Ruminate
an ML library that aims to be lightweight, fast, and generic. 

# Features
* polymorphically based NeuralNetwork with constrained template argument for future LayerTypes
* Activation functions: Relu,Sigmoid,Tanh,Swish
* fast initialization of weights and biases using pcg32 implementation from https://github.com/wjakob/pcg32

# :construction:In Progress
* FC layers

# Future Features
* dropout layer
* convalutions and pooling
* more activation functions
* optimizer argument for network
* GPU integration
